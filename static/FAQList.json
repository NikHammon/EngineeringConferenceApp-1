    "description": "It is a 3-day conference which provides engineering students a hands-on experience to solve contemporary problems through education, collaboration, and debate while investing in sustainable solutions. On Day 1, students get to learn from professionals how to code, CAD, and run simulations. On Day 2, they work in teams to come up with the best designed solution. On Day 3, teams present their design, compete through debate, and finally vote for the best solution.",
